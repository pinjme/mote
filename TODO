for some reason, code does not run when it is in ->run of V8Engine (only when it is run in the constructor).  Need to learn more about context scopes, etc

use our nice logger class instead of global functions.  Including fatal()?

use some test framework instead of a bunch of "test" files?

make sure V8Engine compiles all v8 code into one .o so compile times are fast!
